Therefore, we need to put a microcontroller-friendly ESC on the board. 1.1 Body Cover Removal Remove 4 body clipping pins as circled in the picture below. 1.2 Stock ESC Removal Disconnect and remove the battery. Unplug the motor wires (blue and yellow) on the ESC end. Unplug two sets of signal wires with Futaba connectors on the ESC 3x3 pin connector. Cut the zip-tie on the signal wires. Remove two screws locking the stock ESC. The frame that embracing the steering servo motor will be revealed after removal of the stock ESC. 1.3 Quicrun ESC Installation You can simply tape the Quicrun ESC on top of the servo frame. Connect the motor wires (yellow and blue) to the new ESC (matching the color is recommended). It is recommended to mount the new ESC in direction as below picture shown. Set the driving mode to F/R by removing the jumper cap on the top row of the 3x2 header pins. Notify the ESC that LiPO battery will be used by placing the jumper cat on the bottom row of the 3x2 header pins. 2 Wire Splitter Assembly The wire splitter splits the 2 input channel into 4 output channels. The channels in same color are connected together. We recommend you to plug positive wires to the orange channels, and negative wires to the blue channels. (Optional) Peel extra skin off the wires. Or the levers may bite the skins instead of the exposed metal (broken circuit). Insert wires with male T-plug connector to the input end. Insert wires with female T-plug connector to the output end. Insert wires with JST-XH connector to the output end.
