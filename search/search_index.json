Therefore, we need to put a microcontroller-friendly ESC on the board. 1.1 Body Cover Removal Remove 4 body clipping pins as circled in the picture below. 1.2 Stock ESC Removal Disconnect and remove the battery. Unplug the motor wires (blue and yellow) on the ESC end. Unplug two sets of signal wires with Futaba connectors on the ESC 3x3 pin connector. Cut the zip-tie on the signal wires. Remove two screws locking the stock ESC. The frame that embracing the steering servo motor will be revealed after removal of the stock ESC. 1.3 Quicrun ESC Installation You can simply tape the Quicrun ESC on top of the servo frame. Connect the motor wires (yellow and blue) to the new ESC (matching the color is recommended). It is recommended to mount the new ESC in direction as below picture shown. Set the driving mode to F/R by removing the jumper cap on the top row of the 3x2 header pins. Notify the ESC that LiPO battery will be used by placing the jumper cat on the bottom row of the 3x2 header pins. 2 Wire Splitter Assembly The wire splitter splits the 2 input channel into 4 output channels. The channels in same color are connected together. We recommend you to plug positive wires to the orange channels, and negative wires to the blue channels. (Optional) Peel extra skin off the wires. Or the levers may bite the skins instead of the exposed metal (broken circuit). Insert wires with male T-plug connector to the input end. Insert wires with female T-plug connector to the output end. Insert wires with JST-XH connector to the output end. WARNING: Finger pinch hazard. 2.1 Pre-Assembled 2.2 Post-Assembled 3 Frame Bed Assembly 3.1 Splitter Assembly Installation 2xM2.5-12 screws and 2xM2.5 nuts. 3.2 RPi Power Expansion Board Installation 4xM2.5-15 standoffs (Optional) 4xM2.5 nuts, for under the bed secure. 3.3 Raspberry Pi 5 Installation 22-Pin to 15-Pin RPi camera cable. It is recommended to attach the camera cable at this step. Watch out camera cable's direction. 3.4 Pico Carrier Installation 4xM2.5-6 screws 4 Frame Handle Assembly 4.1 Handle Bed Assembly 3xM4-10 screws 4.2 Raspberry Pi Camera Assembly Watch out for camera cable's direction. 4.3 Camera Assembly Installation 5 Car-Frame Integration 5.1 Attach ESC switch 5.2 ESC and Servo Wiring White - Sig Red - VBEC Black - GND 5.3 Connect Power Wires Male T-plug to battery. Female T-plug to ESC. JST-XH to RPi power expansion board. 5.4 Finish Frame Assembly Fasten frame bed to car chassis. Connect Pico and Pi 5 using micro-USB cable. Connect battery.","title":"Assembly Guide"},{"location":"assembly/#hardware-customization-guide","text":"We recommend you to follow the orders below to assemble your BearCar","title":"Hardware Customization Guide"},{"location":"assembly/#1-esc-upgrade","text":"The RC car comes with a receiver integrated ESC, which is not ideal for hacking the drivetrain (Thank to DonkeyCar's FAQ ).

Note: this is just the signal paths. Drivetrain Wiring Connect the battery to ESC, so that the Pico board can order it (ESC) to squeeze some juice and spin the motors. Explain the Drivetrain The ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) governs the main engine motor's speed. And thus, it determines how fast the BearCar can go. The servo motor (underneath ESC) has a position feedback circuit built-in. Hence, it determines the steering angle of the BearCar. The Quicrun 1060 Brushed ESC has a BEC (Battery Elimination Circuit). It is capable of outputting 6V 3A electric energy. It is used to power the steering servo, and thus eliminates the need for another battery. Neither Raspberry Pi 5 nor the Pico board is powerful enough to directly drive the motors (especially the main engine). So, a battery pack like a LiPO battery is needed to satisfy the energy hungry motors. The Pico board uses 50Hz PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to tell ESC how fast the main engine should run. The Pico board also uses 50Hz PWM signal to tell servo what angle it should spin to.","title":"Wiring Guide"},{"location":"wiring/#wiring-diagrams","text":"","title":"Wiring Diagrams"},{"location":"wiring/#breadboard-experiment-with-pico-esc-and-servo","text":"For electronics beginners, we highly recommend to set up the circuit on a breadboard following the diagram below.
